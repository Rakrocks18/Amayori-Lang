# üåê Chimera Compiler

**Welcome to Chimera!**  
This repository contains the development from version **v0.2.0** onward of the Chimera compiler. Earlier versions, including the initial **v0.1**, were kept private, serving as the foundational experiment for what's now evolving into something much more ambitious.

### üéØ **What is Chimera?**  
Chimera began as a simple college project but has grown into a collaborative effort with a bigger goal:

> **Chimera aims to be a universal compiler, enabling seamless coordination between multiple languages** ‚Äî whether it's Python, Java, or C++. Imagine writing code in multiple languages and having one compiler to bridge them all effortlessly.

With this, we‚Äôre working toward making language interoperability smoother and more efficient than ever before. If you're passionate about compilers or language design, you‚Äôre in the right place!

### üöÄ **Development Roadmap**

We're focusing on iterative, achievable milestones to ensure steady growth while maintaining high-quality standards. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre tackling next:

- [ ] **Implement [rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)'s semantics in entirety to get a strong memory-safe and optimized base for future development. 
- [ ] **Upgrade to LLVM-IR**: Moving from the primitive v0.1 version to LLVM-IR, laying a solid foundation for modern compiler development.
- [ ] **Object-Oriented Support**: Introducing class structures for better modularity and real-world applications.

This roadmap will be updated regularly to reflect new goals and community-driven priorities.
