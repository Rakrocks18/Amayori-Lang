# üåê Amayori Compiler

**Welcome to Amayori!**  
This repository contains the development from version **v0.2.0** onward of the Amayori compiler. Earlier versions, including the initial **v0.1**, were kept private, serving as the foundational experiment for what's now evolving into something much more ambitious.

### üéØ **What is Amayori?**  
Amayori began as a simple college project but has grown into a collaborative effort with a bigger goal:

> **Amayori aims to be a universal compiler, enabling seamless coordination between multiple languages** ‚Äî whether it's Python, Java, or C++. Imagine writing code in multiple languages and having one compiler to bridge them all effortlessly.

With this, we‚Äôre working toward making language interoperability smoother and more efficient than ever before. If you're passionate about compilers or language design, you‚Äôre in the right place!

### üöÄ **Development Roadmap**

We're focusing on iterative, achievable milestones to ensure steady growth while maintaining high-quality standards. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre tackling next:

- [ ] **Upgrade to LLVM-IR**: Moving from the primitive v0.1 version to LLVM-IR, laying a solid foundation for modern compiler development.
- [ ] **Core Language Features**: Adding support for essential programming constructs like functions, loops, and fundamental data types.
- [ ] **Object-Oriented Support**: Introducing class structures for better modularity and real-world applications.
- [ ] **Advanced Data Structures**: Expanding support for non-primitive types such as arrays and vectors.
- [ ] **Pattern Matching & I/O**: Implementing advanced control flow mechanisms like pattern matching, and enhancing input/output capabilities.

This roadmap will be updated regularly to reflect new goals and community-driven priorities.
