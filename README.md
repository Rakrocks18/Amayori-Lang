# Amayori Compiler
This repository contains the version starting from 1.0.0 of the Amayori compiler. The Version 0.1 is in my private repo is, very primitive.

This originally started as a simple college project, but now my team and I want to take this to the next level. Our goal is very simple.
<br>
<br>
> A compiler which can serve as a middle-point for all other languages. A language where one can co-ordinate between codes return in, let's say Python, Java and C++, and still make it work.

## Development Roadmap <br>

The current roadmap is as follows: <br>
- [ ] Shifting 0.1 version to LLVM-IR <br>
- [ ] Support for functions, loops and datatypes <br>
- [ ] Support for classes <br>
- [ ] Support for non-primitive datatypes like arrays & vector <br>
- [ ] Support for structures like pattern-matching, input & output

The Roadmap will keep getting updated as we move on in the development. We don't to overwhelm ourselves to too big of a goal right now.
